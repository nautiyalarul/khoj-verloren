    Task distribution


I will look after the microcontroller part





    arul : electronic programming guy,
    - work products : something resulting from a task
         a set of web services to interface with google
         code for the pic with:


I will try to do the below code with u - (yellow area )


               one module for gps control
               one module for ether control




               one module for gui interface
                     one module(widget) for small keyboard buttons
                     one module(widget) for selection menu to choose a location from bookmarks
                     one module(widget) to show the current location estimated address name & numeric geo coords
                     one module(widget) to say "please wait..." and to show later a set of directions


these below doc i can do (yellow area )


    code documentation for web services software
          code documentation for eacg electronic module


these below doc will be done by both us -  (pink area )


          planning document
          requirements/specification document
          design document
          final ppt document
          final report document

    - tasks: a thing/action do be done by each of the roles
    ....

    There are 6 engineering disciplines http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Unified_Process#Six_engineering_disciplines
    each of those disciplines apply in each phase of the project. I would say this is a bit like roles above...



    I think this is the task that we can share -




    Business modeling discipline; => communicaton with Guillaume Jacquemin & PPT making + documents beautifyiing/layouts


I will ask u to suggest me more in this -  ( as u know and done lot on API )

    Requirements discipline => estimate what we want for the project if it's not to much or what.


I will do it with u after the above Requirements discipline

    Establish a well defined list of things that will be implemented/done and why not things that won't.


I will do it

    Analysis and design discipline => see how things should be designed using what technos.


We will do it together

    Implementation discipline => implement each part



    Test discipline => unit test each part (techno) + check the docs.



    Deployment discipline => deploy each part so it's deliverable/reusable/rebuildable by others.



What u think ,

I will come up with some idea ..in the next mail .
